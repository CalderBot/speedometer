This is an analogue-style speedometer gauge, written with the Raphael.js svg toolset.

Features:
-Easily configurable by adjusting self-explanatory parameters at the top of the gauge.js file.  
-Gauge fills a user-chosen percentage of its container, and re-scales itself upon window resize.  It looks darn good both on monitors and mobile devices.
-Displays current, max, and average of the input parameter (most commonly speed, but I used it for cadence on a cycling app as well).

Can be used on a mobile phone, with speed delivered from navigator.geolocation, to provide a fun alternative to your car or bicycle speedometer.
